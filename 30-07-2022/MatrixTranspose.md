### Description
Given two 2D integer arrays A and B, determine if array B is the transpose of array A.

The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, switching the matrix's row and column indices.

### Example 1
```
A = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
B = [[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]]
```
Output
```
true
```


### Example 2
```
A = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
B = [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]
```
Output
```
true
```


### Example 3
```
A = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
B = [[1,4,2],[5,3,6]]
```
Output
```
false
```
