### Descriptiom
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

`s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
